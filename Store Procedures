-- Use the below database design for this project 
-- There are two procedures and one table to fetch the records.

-- Create database 
create database dbUser

-- create table named as UserProfile
create table UserProfile
(
  up_id int identity(1,1),
  up_name nvarchar(50)
)

-- create first store procedures to fetch total numbers of records.

CREATE procedure [dbo].[getTotalUsers]
as 

select COUNT(um_id) from dbo.UserProfile 


--- create this second store procedure to get number of records.


CREATE procedure [dbo].[GetUser]
(
    @startRowIndex int, 
    @maximumRows int
)
AS 

declare @firstInt int, @startRow int
if (@startRowIndex <= (select COUNT(um_id) from dbo.UserProfile))
begin
    set ROWCOUNT @startRowIndex

    select @firstInt = um_id from dbo.UserProfile order by um_id

    set ROWCOUNT @maximumRows

    select um_id, um_name
    from dbo.UserProfile where um_id >= @firstInt order by um_id

    set ROWCOUNT 0
